# Custom Utility Tools

Custom Utility tools is a useful tool that allows the developers of an app to use features without having to import a large amount of libraries, and is extremely feature-rich, with things like Machine Learning, API Integrations to programs like Gemini or ChatGPT, and things like Face recognition, object recognition, and more!

### Requirements

2. 8GB RAM
3. A GPU (Including builtin gpus)

## Storage

To be honest, 36 GB for Custom Utility tools is a lot! But, due to many functions, you need atleast 36 GB for all the features. But as long as you dont use face recognition,  ollama, and nltk you can just use 20 GB. The reason why it is so big is due to the massive models in face recognition, and ollama. For example, in ollama, llama3 is almost 5 GB by itself! Face recognition uses almost 7 GB, and NLTK uses 4 GB.
